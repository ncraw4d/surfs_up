# Hawaii Temperature Analysis

The purpose of the analysis was to show the differences in temperatures between two different months. One month, June, is in the summer, and the second month, December is in the winter. The company wanted to see how succesful a surf and ice cream shop would be year round. The company wanted to know if the temperatures would be high enough in colder months to justify customers still purchasing ice cream and renting surfboards. The analysis showed that even though December had cooler temperatures the median temperature would still be high enough for a surf and ice cream shop to be successful.

The above photos show the differences in the statistical summary of the temperature data for June and December. These statistics show that the fluctuation of temperatures in Hawaii are minor compared to other parts of the country. Hawaii's temperatures are moderate and allow for a different lifestyle for its tourists and citizens. 

- The difference in the mean temperatures was just under 4 degrees. In June the average temperature was 75 degrees and in December it was 71 degrees. The flucation of temperature was fairly minimal which shows tourists would still be likely to shop for ice cream and rent surfboards. 

- The data analysis does show there maybe a few days in December where the shop would be less likely to have customers. The minimum temperature in December was 56 degrees. Since the 3 quartiles are not too far off of June's quartiles, this minimum temperature was an outlier versus a regular temperature.
